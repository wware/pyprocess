I'll help design a similar architecture for a local Replit-like system.
We'll focus on defining the core models and interfaces that would be needed
for code execution, file management, and session handling.

This design provides the core building blocks for a Replit-like system:

- Project Management: Project model and ProjectStorage interface for managing workspaces
- File Handling: File model and FileStorage interface for file operations
- Code Execution: CodeExecutor interface for running code with ExecutionResult tracking
- Environment Management: RuntimeEnvironment interface for handling isolated execution environments

You could implement these interfaces with:

- ProjectStorage: SQLite or file system storage
- FileStorage: Local filesystem with project directories
- CodeExecutor: Process-based execution using subprocess or container-based execution using Docker
- RuntimeEnvironment: Virtual environments for Python, Node.js for JavaScript, etc.

The system supports basic features like:

- Multiple projects per user
- File management within projects
- Code execution with output capture
- Language-specific environment isolation
- Resource usage monitoring

## So I banged on this a bit more

I prompted the AI (the assistant in Cursor IDE) to generate a types-and-interfaces
level architecture for the Replit clone. I prompted it to improve the documentation
and comments.
